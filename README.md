Sahara
======

Tweaked version of the desert256 colorscheme for Vim without the clunky color detection code. More subdued status bars, tab bars, and line numbers, and some simple highlight grouping links to make HTML editing in particular look just a bit less visually noisy than it does with the original colorscheme.
